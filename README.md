Directory Links
#dirlinks
==================

I wanted to create a directory link class for my virtual hosts on my dev box. 
The features I looked to implement are:
  1. have the index file refer to the server root directory i.e. htdocs for public assets
  2. have the class in the vhost directory
  2. automatically get the correct index files
  3. Be able to ignore index.html in css, js, etc files
  4. make them links
  5. Use PHP iterator classes
  6. Be able to specify which port the host is on
  
Installation:

  1. Put dirlinks folder in the virtual host directory and create host
  
I will implement S-UI in the future.
